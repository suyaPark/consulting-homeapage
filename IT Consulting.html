          <h3>How is it different from other outsourcing?</h3>
          <p>▷  Developed by Vietnamese professionals, more cost-effective.<br>
              ▷  From project management to development professional IT personnel (in-service developers) participate in consulting before requesting development.<br>
              ▷  Progress from prototype to design to development even if you only have an idea<br>
              ▷  Compared to other countries, the cost is 30% lower<br>

          <h3>Why work with P&D Consulting on your IT project?</h3>
          <p>▶  We are a professional startup that has been developing and operating our own platforms and ERP tools since 2018.<br>
            ▶  We are attracting investment and operating services by developing IT services. <br>
            ▶  We have a good understanding of the business and pursue sustainable development in the business, not just short-term projects. <br>
            ▶  New platforms should be created sequentially from core functions rather than spending a large budget from the beginning<br>
            ▶  Introduce a minimum set of features to users and then evolve in a way that shows promise for growth.<br>
            ▶  Continuous feature improvement is necessary and should be managed by developers with a good attitude.<br>
            ▶  After development, we can introduce you to our investor network (VCs, Angels) and guide you on how to promote/market/hire.<br>

          <h3>What is the development process?</h3>
          <p>▷  If you have a detailed brief, we will quote you a price.<br>
            ▷  If you don't have a detailed plan, we will prototype and quote you.<br>
            ▷  Once we start development, we'll work on the design, front-end, and database design.<br>
            ▷  Project code is generated and deployed to the server after backend development.<br>
            ▷  We use task management tools and chat to share progress with the client<br>
            ▷  After development is complete, we launch the service and move into the maintenance phase.

          <h2>Process Details</h2>
          <h5>Is a detailed plan ready?</h5>
          <p>If you have a detailed plan ready to go, we can proceed directly to calculating the quote. If you don't have a detailed plan, P&D Consulting can prototype with you first.</p>
          <img src="sd" alt="">
          <h5>Prototyping</h5>
          <img class="img1" src="./assets/img/prototype1.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
          <p>When you hire P&D Consulting for prototyping, one of our developers will work through a prototyping plan using Figma. Finger prototyping is more effective than written plans because we work on the front end of every page as close to the actual development result as possible.</p>
          <img clas="img2" src="./assets/img/prototype2.png" alt="" style="max-width: 60%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
          <p>The cost is $100 per page, with a 50% discount if you decide to move forward with development after the prototyping is complete. For example, a service with 50 screens would cost $5,000 to prototype and we'll discount $2500 when we decide to go into development. <br>The discount is possible because the prototyping is improved and used as the front-end code, and the development period is shortened.<br><br>
            The prototyping deliverable does not include any code, only the prototyped screen is included in the deliverable. Your code will be included in your deliverables when you start development
          </p>
          <h5>Calculating estimates</h5>
          <img src="./assets/img/price1.png" alt="" class="img3" style="max-width: 70%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
          <p>Once you have a detailed plan or prototype, you'll create an estimate based on it. This is a lengthy process because it involves detailed measurements of each page's implementation elements, but it's accurate enough that you can lock in development costs and stay on schedule. The image below shows a page where a developer calculates an estimate for an individual screen.<br><br>
            Clients can see the entire page and the implementation elements and their costs for each page through the cost pages, as shown in the image below. You are billed for the parts of the implementation that have been completed, including the total quote, the total amount billed, and the amount paid to date
          </p>
          <h5>Contract and start development</h5>
          <img src="./assets/img/price2.png" alt="" class="img3" style="max-width: 50%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
          <p>After confirming the development quotation, the client decides whether to proceed or not. After signing the contract and making the deposit, a developer will be assigned to start the development. <br>We will invite you to the Slack or Notion page to adjust the development set. From then on, you can charge the development fee in increments of 10,000 USD as the development progresses.
          </p>
          <h5>Front-end development</h5>
          <p>If the client has prepared a design prototype, we will reflect the design when working on the frontend. If there is no design prototype, we will make minor improvements to the design according to the client's preferences during front-end development. </p>
          <img src="./assets/img/fix img.png" alt="" class="img4" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
          <p>Here's an example of a design improvement we made to the frontend without a design mockup. It's not a unique design, but it's simple, clear, and customisable with colours, button rounding, etc.</p>
          <h5>Database modelling</h5>
          <p>Based on your front-end work, we design the database in consultation with you, and then build it into the database cloud. The Figma tool enables project managers to design quickly and securely and facilitates collaboration between developers. </p>
          <img src="./assets/img/datamodeling.png" alt="" class="img5" style="max-width: 50%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
          <h5>Create and deploy your project</h5>
          <p>Once the front-end development and database modelling is complete, you'll create a code project, save it to your source code repository, and deploy it to the cloud to test access in a browser. From then on, you can proceed with development in your local environment and see the results of your implementation after deployment.
          </p>
          <h5>Managing tasks</h5>
          <p>In the Cost Invoice, you can check whether the development of the implementation elements that you calculated in your estimate has been completed. When the implementation is complete, the developer will tick the box and you will be charged the corresponding amount. You can see how far the development has progressed and which features have been completed.</p>

              <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
              <p>Q. How much does it cost to develop an app?<br>
                A. In order to provide you with an accurate quote, we need to have a detailed brief from you or a prototype that you have created with us before we can provide you with a detailed quote. Please leave us an inquiry and we will respond to you about the process.<br><br>
                Q. Will you create an admin page for me?<br>
                A. We will provide you with a quote for a basic admin page during the quote walkthrough. Once we have an approximate number of tables, we will create a basic admin page that allows you to edit, delete, view, and create each table, and if you need additional management functions, we will also guide you through the development work.<br><br>
                Q. How do I create various accounts such as app store, SNS, hosting, etc?<br>
                A. We will guide you to create social login accounts, payment provider accounts, server and database hosting accounts, app store accounts, etc. that you need for your project. Don't worry, we'll send you a document with instructions when you need the accounts. The reason for this is to ensure that your internal operations will be smooth even after development is complete.<br><br>
                Q. After the development is completed, can I request maintenance?<br>
                A. We provide free maintenance for 3 months after development is completed. After 3 months, you can sign an annual maintenance contract. We have customers who have been entrusting us with maintenance for three to four years. We consider development to be complete when the agreed upon features are implemented, the service is released to the public or to the app store, or development is suspended due to the customer's circumstances.<br><br>
                Q. I have a limited budget, how do I determine the scope of development?<br>
                A. We will coordinate the development scope with the client's budget. Even for the same second-hand trading platform, depending on whether the budget is 30 million won, 50 million won, or 80 million won, the developer will consider whether to implement only core item posting and minimal communication functions, payment and settlement, or chat and community functions during the quotation calculation stage.
